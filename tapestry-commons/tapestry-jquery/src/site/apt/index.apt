JQuery

 This module builds on the tapestry-javascript stack support and automatically includes jQuery
 in your pages. It automatically calls jQuery.noConflict() so be aware that you will need to 
 write any jQuery code using the 'jQuery' or map it to another short hand form to avoid conflicts
 with Scriptaculous.

Usage

 Simply add a dependency on this to your project and on pages you want to use Jquery add
 @Import( stack = "Jquery")
