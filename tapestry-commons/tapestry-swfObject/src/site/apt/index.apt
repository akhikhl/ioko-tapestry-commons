Introduction

 This library lets you simply include a flash movies in a tapestry page. It will insert the swf using Swfobject and lets you easily pass information through to it.

Tips

 Opera appears to have issues with long paths to SWF files - I am unclear what the percise limit is by 66 character after the / works, whereas 73 doesn't. The symptom of this is the movie 'loads' but it does auto-play. If you right click it and press play it works.

 Firefox has similar issues with load when tapestry gzip support is enabled AND you serve the flash movie as an asset.
