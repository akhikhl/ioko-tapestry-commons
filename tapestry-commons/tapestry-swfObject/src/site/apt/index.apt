Introduction

 This library lets you simply include a flash movies in a tapestry page. It will insert the swf using Swfobject and lets you easily pass information through to it.

Usage

 Add the component referencing your SWF.

+--
<div t:id="swfObject" t:type="ioko/swfObject" width="300" height="300" swf="asset:SwfObjectTest.swf"
     flashvars="flashVars">
    <p>Non Flash Content</p>
</div>
+--

 The flashvars parameters (also attributes and params) are JSON parameters. You need to create a property in your page class to initialise it.

+--
    @Property
	private JSONObject flashVars;

	public void setupRender() {
		flashVars = new JSONObject();
		flashVars.append("Cat", "Parsnip");
		flashVars.append("Vegetable", "Turnip");
	}
+--

 The items you pass throught this way are accessible in Flash.

Tips

 Opera appears to have issues with long paths to SWF files - I am unclear what the percise limit is by 66 character after the / works, whereas 73 doesn't. The symptom of this is the movie 'loads' but it does auto-play. If you right click it and press play it works.

 Firefox has similar issues with load when tapestry gzip support is enabled AND you serve the flash movie as an asset.
